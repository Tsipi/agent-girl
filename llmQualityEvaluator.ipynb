      "You're advising the mayor of a coastal city of 5 million people with 40 km of shoreline that will experience a median sea-level rise of 0.5 m and a change in extreme events such that a current 1-in-100-year coastal flood becomes a 1-in-10-year event within 25 years. The city can choose one of three mutually exclusive strategies: (A) build a continuous seawall costing $8B that protects 70% of current built value but would require relocation of 30,000 informal-settlement residents, (B) implement a distributed resilience program costing $5B (elevation of structures, floodproofing, restoration of wetlands and green infrastructure, targeted social programs) that reduces expected annual damages by 40% and explicitly prioritizes low-income neighborhoods, or (C) adopt a phased adaptive/mixed strategy costing $6.5B now with contingent triggers and reserves for escalation later. Your stated objectives, in order, are (1) minimize expected cumulative loss of life and economic damage over the next 25 years, and (2) maximize equity measured as the reduction in expected losses for the poorest 20% of residents. Based only on the information above and by making and stating explicit assumptions where needed, which option would you recommend and why? Provide (a) the quantitative comparison of expected cumulative damages to life and economy for each option over 25 years (show your model, equations, parameters, and any discount rate you use), (b) the ethical trade-offs and distributional impacts, (c) the key uncertainties and plausible failure modes for your chosen plan, (d) what additional data you would request before a final decision and how that data would change the analysis, (e) a concrete adaptive decision rule (including thresholds and timing) for switching strategies if early indicators show outcomes diverging from projections, and (f) three measurable early-warning indicators (one to monitor in year 1, one in year 5, one in year 10) that a city council could use to evaluate whether the strategy is succeeding — all in a level of detail sufficient for expert scrutiny.\n"
